# [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com) Exercises
This repository consists of the excercies completed as part of the courses offered through DataCamp, a data science e-learning platform, which can be accessed via the link above. If you have an interest in learning data science, it is a highly valuable and accessible resource. The information contained in this repository is for personal and professional reference and is no substitute for the wealth of knowledge attained from completing the courses for oneself.

Code blocks will not use syntax highlighting, rather than the language specific syntax, since the language specific syntax does not always produce accurate results. For example, the pipe operator `%>%` in R's magrittr package when highlighted with syntax for R will result in the greater than `>` sign being highlighted instead of the entire operator. For this reason, syntax highlighting in code blocks will not be utilized.

For an example of markdown proficiency along with the adjoining exercises, please see [`Introduction to R`](https://github.com/Delimain/DataCamp_Exercises/tree/master/Introduction_to_R). All other files will contain only the completed exercises.
